= Rails 3 Base App
This is a generic base application which other rails apps can use as a place to start. It includes:

* Authentication (via Devise)
* Testing
  * Cucumber
    * Configured to use RSpec and Capybara for steps
    * Generator
  * RSpec for tests
  * Machinist for fixtures
* Javascript
  * JQuery (note: RJS still does prototype)
* Joy from not having to set this stuff up for yourself over and over again!
